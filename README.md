Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/) at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/), supervised by Prof. [Irwin King](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/irwin.king/home). Blend of academic research and hands-on industry engineering, specializing in Natural Language Processing, Spoken Language Processing, and AI for music with works published. My research mainly focuses on Natural Language Processing, Text-based and Speech-based Large Language Models, and AI Music Generation. Actively seeking opportunities for research internships in language and speech processing, aiming to leverage my refined skills in an industrial setting to contribute significantly to cutting-edge AI research and projects.
